# QRPayment
QRPayment is a payment simulation application built using Firebase. When you click on the I am a customer button, the application generates a QR code for you. When the My Cashier button is clicked, the qr code reading page opens. If you read a QR code created by the application, a picker opens and you can change the payment status instantly. Changes are instantly reflected on the customer's screen. Combine is used for in-app data communication.
